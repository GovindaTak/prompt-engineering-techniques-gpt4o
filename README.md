# prompt-engineering-techniques-gpt4o
Explore and compare various prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.) across GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o models using real-world tasks to evaluate response quality, coherence, and performance. This project highlights the strengths and limitations of each prompting approach and model.
